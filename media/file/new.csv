76854,B00002N8SM,A7E1DYOIQXM12,Hetal Rana,3,4,1,1246147200,Worthless Indoor Trap,"Ineffective and worthless. I bought this product for indoors and two other outdoor fly traps.  The outdoor traps worked immediately and I have noticed less flies in my home from my backdoor over the past week.  However, this indoor trap has caught zero flies yet over one week, while the outdoor traps have caught a combined 75-100.  I get excited looking at the trap thinking a fly was caught, but then realize that is the picture of a fly instead:-(.  Don't waste your money on this product."

I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.  Oops.<br /><br />We had it up for several days and I saw one fly land on it the entire time.  The best part of this tragic story is that when I picked up the trap to investigate the one trapped fly...I'l be darned if that fly didn't pick up his feet and take off. That's right, the fly flew away after landing on this.  None of the other flies in the area even bothered.<br /><br />They should call this the ""sucker"" trap.  The sucker in this case would be me.  Save your money and invest in quicker hand reflexes."

I thought it was a trap where flies entered inside and were trapped, like a roach motel. When I received it, the design looked different, and it was obvious that it was a a square ""tube"" coated with very sticky adhesive, where the flies land and stick. As such, it works but not exactly what I expected. I would have designed it differently, though and put the adhesive on the inside and entrance holes on the outside so it doesn't look so ugly when the flies are caught."

We only have flies in late August and September when the temperature warms.  So we don't have window screens.  The flies were especially bad this year, so I tried the Victor fly trap because I like their rat and mouse traps and didn't want to spray in the kitchen.<br />Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I caught many flies with a little milk in the bottom of a small water bottle.  They flew in and drowned themselves. I don't think California flies are smarter than any others so the trap just doesn't work."

I have had it up for a week with lots of flies around it and they simply avoid it. Infact the will sit on the window next to it but never go to it. Also it does no look like the one pictured You get the idea that there are small boxes for the flies to enter. Not so. Mine came with black and pink srips running from the top to the bottom.

I must have gotten some funky soil because as soon as I repotted, we were being overrun by a large colony of small flies. I was swatting them and getting bug guts on my hand so frequently I stopped bothering with the ""gross!"" exclamations. The fact that in the city of San Francisco, you have to compost just aggravated the situation.<br /><br />I bought one of these nitfy traps and set it by my plant and voila! Instead of my hands getting the daily dose of bug guts, the trap is now lined with the tiny suckers! It's been a few months and the trap is pretty much covered (the gross part) and I need to order another one. Not sure how well this will work on larger inserts but it works really well on these tiny, annoying flies."

It's basically a cardsotck box that is sticky all over the OUTSIDE. Those pink-ish things that look like entrances ""into"" the trap? They're just pictures. There *is no* inside of the trap. All the flies will be stuck to the OUTSIDE. It's basically fly paper, just horribly, horribly HORRIBLY overpriced.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and just get fly paper or fly strips.

Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.

But after 2 weeks, only 1 fly had stuck... I was going around with a notepad and squishing the buggers myself with a success rate of 2-3 a day so clearly this product was useless! I even dabbed to red wine and banana to the top of the column after 1 week because they were really attracted to any red wine I had in a glass... but still it did nothing to get them stuck. And then I actually saw a second fly land on it once, and I watched as it flapped it's wings frantically and within 30 secs it had unstuck itself!!!! This product was a total waste of money!"

76873,B00002N8SM,A1G98WP2G0CMC,"RG77 ""RGarcia""",0,0,2,1284768000,Fly Trap Doesn't Trap Much,Used this fly sticky tape trap in the garage where we had a knat fly problem. We also had some fruit fly type  bugs flying around also. Our neghbor has a big fig tree that isn't pruned of taken care of and all the figs stay on the tree and rot till they dry. Smells really bad and attracts the flys that go into our garage because of its proximity to our garage. We put these up and only caught about 3 to four on each one. We had better results with the sticky traps that unravel. These caught much more knats.
76874,B00002N8SM,A3EAHSVSDAYQ2K,schmalyn,0,0,3,1283040000,Works okay...,"Like others have said, hanging this up is useless. You have to lie it down in an area where the flies like to land. I have caught dozens and dozens of flies with this, however I have noticed that some of these traps are stickier than others. The flies in my house also seem to have figured out how to basically ""walk"" down the trap until they get to the end, where they can get unstuck and fly off. Maybe 25% of the flies escape, and the others are trapped. I actually have taken to pressing the flies into the trap once they land, to try to keep them from escaping, but this is disturbing and I'd rather not have to do that. The Catchmaster Window glue trap is really superior to this product by comparison (but is currently unavailable...)."

I wasn't sure if they still made Fly Paper but when I saw this after searching in the great Amazon I was excited. From the moment I opened the box I was dismayed and I seriously cannot decide if this is a joke or not. The packaging says the box has stunning 3-d images to draw in the flies, these images are perhaps the funniest drawing's I have ever seen being called 3-d...this product has not caught a single fly they simply ignore it and fly everywhere but at the stunningly realistic 3-d images anyone got a better idea?<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS PLAYING A joke on someone"

We were desperate, though, as we had a full-on gnat invasion in our kitchen. We put it in a few places on the counter before settling on one near the coffee pot where the gnats seemed to love to gather. At first they seemed to ignore it, but over the next few days, more and more were finding their way onto the trap. At one point we gave up counting--there were dozens. This product is great for ridding yourself of those pesky gnats. I love that it is poison-free and that it can stand on the countertop if you want it to, as our very tall ceilings would make a hanging strip less than useful. But for those wishing to hang it, there's a little hanger included as well. I can't make a claim about larger flies, we didn't catch any of those--there were none around. And I think there would be better choices for outdoors than this product. But for the $$ this little fly trap did the job we asked it to do, and you can't beat that!"

Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.<br /><br />Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies?
